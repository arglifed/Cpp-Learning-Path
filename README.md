# C++ Systems Programming: Logic & Logging Utility

This repository documents my transition from high-level scripting (Python/HTML) to low-level systems development. The project focuses on building high-performance, memory-efficient backend logic for data processing and system auditing.

## Current Features
- **Buffer Management**: Implements advanced stream clearing using `std::cin.ignore` to handle mixed-type user input reliably.
- **Conditional Logic**: Uses optimized `if/else if` control structures for data classification.
- **Persistent Logging**: Implements File I/O (fstream) to record session data to an external audit log (`access_log.txt`).
- **Real-time Chrono Integration**: Utilizes `<ctime>` to generate ISO-standard timestamps for all logged events.
- **State Management**: Uses persistent `while` loops for continuous session handling without memory leaks.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2026)
- **Environment**: Windows x64
- **Standards**: C++17/20

## Core Objectives
I am developing this utility to master the **PHP/MariaDB/C++** stack. This specific module demonstrates the ability to handle the C++ backend layer, focusing on data integrity, persistent storage, and automated system logging.
