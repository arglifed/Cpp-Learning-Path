# C++ Learning Journey: Grade & Logic Tool

This repository tracks my progress as I transition from Python/HTML into low-level C++ development. This project serves as a foundation for understanding high-performance backend logic, specifically for tracker environments.

## Current Features
- **Data Types & I/O**: Handles string and double-precision inputs.
- **Decision Logic**: Uses `if/else if` chains to categorize data (Elite, Pass, Fail).
- **Memory Management**: Implements basic input buffering with `std::cin.ignore()`.
- **Looping**: Persistent session handling using `while` loops.
- **File I/O**: (Upcoming) Logging session results to local text files.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2026)
- **Architecture**: x64

## Why this exists
I am building this to familiarize myself with the **PHP/MariaDB/C++** stack
